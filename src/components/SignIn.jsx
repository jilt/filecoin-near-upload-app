          This is a simple guestbook app implementation that lets you choose the wallet to connect to the NEAR blockchain.
      </p>
	  <p>
	  The app is built on a guestobbok contract (which you can manipulate as you like) but made to be a template to use web3.storage to store the files of your near dApps to filecoin free immutable storage service

      <p>
          You can sign in the guestbook Dapp and add a donation, then NEAR will double-check that
          youâ€™re ok with sending money to this app.
